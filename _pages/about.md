  As the world enters the era of the internet of things (IoT), sensor networks, and artificial intelligence, a crucial need has become evident for smart functional surfaces for these emerging fields. In the SEMI-Lab, we aim to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of surface engineering by developing novel manufacturing capabilities. We craft theoretical and fundamental frameworks to push the boundaries of surface manufacturing while targeting innvoations in advanced additive manufacturing and rapid prototyping. These endeavors are geared towards designing and fabricating functional smart surfaces for a wide range of practical applications, including 3-D printed electronics, smart films, energy devices, electronic textiles, healthcare, and product design.
