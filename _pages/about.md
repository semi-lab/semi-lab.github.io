  As the world enters the era of the Internet of things (IoT) and sensor networks, a crucial need has become evident for functional smart surfaces for these emerging fields. In SEMI Lab, we aim to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of surface engineering by developing novel manufacturing capabilities. We craft theoretical and fundamental frameworks to push the boundaries of surface manufacturing while targeting innovations in advanced manufacturing and rapid prototyping. These endeavors are geared towards designing and fabricating functional smart surfaces for a wide range of practical applications, including 3-D printed electronics, smart films, energy devices, electronic textiles, healthcare, and product design.
