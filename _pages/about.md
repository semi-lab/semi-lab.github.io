  As the world enters the era of the Internet of things (IoT), sensor networks, and in-space manufacturing, the demand for highly functional smart surfaces has become increasingly critical. At the SEMI Lab, we aim to shape the future of surface engineering by developing cutting-edge additive manufacturing capabilities that enable next-generation functionality. We craft theoretical and fundamental frameworks to push the boundaries of surface manufacturing while targeting innovations in additive manufacturing manufacturing and rapid prototyping. These endeavors are geared towards designing and fabricating functional smart surfaces for a wide range of practical applications, including in-space manufacturing, physical unclonable functions, 3-D printed electronics, smart films, energy devices, electronic textiles, and product design.
