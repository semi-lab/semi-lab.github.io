SEMI-Lab focuses on bridging a critical gap between engineering and unmet clinical needs. Our scholarly efforts are dedicated to addressing the gap using novel yet simple microscale transducers with a clear path towards translation into measurable economic and societal impacts. We explore a variety type of wearable biomedical devices that are safely attachable to the skin or eye, allowing for continuous remote assessment of human health and diseases. The pragmatic application of these devices is boundless ranging from healthcare to rehabilitation and to telemedicine.

Our research group fosters a collaborative, interdisciplinary, and welcoming environment. We are dedicated to cultivating the collective growth of our entire team, pushing the boundaries of knowledge, and generating innovative solutions in the cutting-edge fields of Advanced Multi-Scale Manufacturing.


Future manufacturing relies on significant advances in manufacturing science, theory, and material. At the Smarture lab, we aim to enable and shape the future of manufacturing by creating novel manufacturing capabilities and smart decision-support systems and theoretical frameworks to further enhance the responsiveness, robustness, and efficiency of next-generation manufacturing. Our research is focused on the interplay of smart, sustainable, and advanced manufacturing, addresses the different levels of product, process, and system, and spans over many topics including robotics, additive manufacturing, future electronics, cyber-physical systems, product design, and healthcare.


Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
