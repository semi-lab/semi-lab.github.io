As the world enters the era of the internet of things (IoT), artificial 
intelligence, and sensor networks, a crucial need has become evident for smart functional surfaces for these emerging fields. In the SEMI-Lab, we aim to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of surface manufacturing by developing novel manufacturing capabilities for functional and smart surfaces. We craft theoretical and fundamental frameworks to push the boundaries of next-generation surface manufacturing technologies while targeting innvoations in advanced additive manufacturing and rapid prototyping. These endeavors are geared towards designing and fabricating functional smart surfaces for a wide range of practical applications, including 3-D printed future electronics, smart films, electronic textiles, product design, healthcare, and energy devices.

Our group is committed to humbly and tirelessly battling against intricate surface structures. We are dedicated to cultivating the collective growth of our entire team, pushing the limits of knowledge, and creating innovative solutions in the forefront areas of surface engineering and multi-scale additive manufacturing.
