  Our group is dedicated to cultivating the collective growth of our entire team, pushing the limits of knowledge, and creating innovative solutions in the forefront areas of surface engineering and multi-scale additive manufacturing. 
  
## Prospective Students

The SEMI-Lab is seeking for enthusiastic students at various levels of PhD, Masters, and undergraduate, who have an interest in surface engineering, additive manufacturing, printed electronics, electronic textiles, and energy devices. If interested, please send your CV to Prof. Akin at <a href="mailto:sakine@purdue.edu">sakin@purdue.edu</a>. 

## Open Ph.D. Positions

We have several opening positions for Ph.D. students with the following research interests, and skills. Previous backgrounds can include (but are not limited to) mechanical engineering, materials science, and electrical engineering. If you are interested, please contact Dr. Akin at <a href="mailto:sakine@purdue.edu">sakin@purdue.edu</a>.
