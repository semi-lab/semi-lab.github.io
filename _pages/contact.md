## Prospective Students
Our research group fosters passion, creativity, synergy, and is interdisciplinary and collaborative by nature. We cultivate the collective growth of the whole team, as we enter this new era of microelectronics where there are increasing global demands for a new generation of innovators traversing and blurring traditional boundaries.

Our research team nurtures enthusiasm, originality, cooperation, and thrives on interdisciplinarity and collaboration. We actively promote the overall development of our team members as we embark on a new era in microelectronics, responding to rising global demands for a fresh breed of innovators who transcend and dissolve conventional boundaries.


We are mostly looking for students with research background and interests in the following areas.

Nanoelectronics: device fabrication and integration, characterization, device modeling.
VLSI circuits: digital/analog circuit design, chip tapeout, domain-specific accelerators.
Machine learning, computational neuroscience, emerging application spaces (e.g., AR/VR, autonomous systems, healthcare).
Meanwhile, beyond what’s mentioned above, we also believe that unique and diverse experiences can often generate new sparks to explore uncharted territory.



## Ph.D. Students

Multiple fully-funded Ph.D. positions are available for Fall 2023. If you are interested in joining the NanoX research group, please feel free to contact me via email with your CV, transcript, and a brief description of your research background and interests.

When submitting your applications to Purdue ECE’s Graduate Programs (deadline: Dec. 1st, 2022), you may want to mention the faculty of interest in your statement.



## M.S. and Undergrad Students
If you are currently a M.S. or undergrad student at Purdue and would like to chat about research opportunities (and potentially collaborative projects with industry), please feel free to reach out via email!

If you are a student from another university, we may discuss potential visiting research projects for Summer 2023 (remote or in-person). Please send an email to start discussions.
