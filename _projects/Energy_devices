In the SEMI-Lab, we design and develop 3D-printed smart structures that seamlessly integrate energy devices and advanced sensing capabilities within the material architecture. Leveraging state-of-the-art additive manufacturing, we embed energy harvesting, storage, and sensing functionalities into metallic, polymer, and composite systems, enabling self-powered operation, smart sensing, and real-time structural health monitoring. Our research encompasses triboelectric nanogenerators and multifunctional embedded sensors, advancing resilient and sustainable technologies for aerospace, defense, and space applications.
