Our group develops physics-based models that capture the thermal, mechanical, and materials-level phenomena governing advanced additive manufacturing processes. By elucidating fundamental process–structure–property relationships, we enable predictive simulation, data-informed process optimization, and defect-aware design strategies. These modeling capabilities serve as a foundation for accelerating innovation across our advanced AM research portfolio and for enhancing the reliability, performance, and scalability of next-generation AM technologies.<br>
<br>
<b> Our current research directions:</b>
<ul>
<li> <b> Data-driven surrogate modeling for rapid AM process prediction</b> </li>
<li> <b> Physics-informed machine learning for process–structure–property mapping </b> </li>
<li> <b> Multiphysics simulation of thermo-mechanical interactions </b> </li>
<li> <b> Simulation-driven process optimization
