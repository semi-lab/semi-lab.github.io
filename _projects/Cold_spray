title: Cold Spray Additive Manufacturing
description: Cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM) is a revolutionary technology with significant importance in the realm of advanced manufacturing. Unlike traditional additive manufacturing methods, CSAM relies on supersonic gas jets to deposit functional particles at high velocities, creating dense and high-quality coatings without the need for melting or extensive post-processing.

CSAM offers unique advantages, enabling the production of complex, high-performance components with enhanced durability and reduced material waste.
Its remarkable features have a profound impact on industries by revolutionizing surface manufacturing and fostering sustainable practices. 
<br>
We aim to uncover process-structure-property relationships of the CSAM to unlock its unique potential in various industries. 
For these endeavors, we thoroughly investigate CSAM, from in-flight to upon-impact characteristics of the particles, as well as microstructural characterization. Our overarching objective is to explore this emerging AM technique to create functional and self-powered smart surfaces for the realm of Internet of
Things (IoT).
<br>
<br>
<b> Our current directions include:</b>
<ul>
<li> <b> Multifield modeling of CSAM. </b> </li>
<li> <b> Design and development of smart and self-powered surfaces for IoT. </b>
<li> <b> Sustainable repairing of printed electronics </b> </li>
