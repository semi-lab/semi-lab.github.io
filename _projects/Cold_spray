title: Cold Spray Additive Manufacturing
description: Cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM) is a revolutionary technology with significant importance in the realm of advanced manufacturing. Unlike traditional additive manufacturing methods, CSAM relies on supersonic gas jets to deposit functional particles at high velocities, creating dense and high-quality coatings without the need for melting or extensive post-processing.

CSAM offers unique advantages, enabling the production of complex, high-performance components with enhanced durability.
Its remarkable features have a profound impact on industries by revolutionizing surface manufacturing and fostering sustainable practices. 
Our aim is to uncover the process-structure-property connections of CSAM, unlocking its potential in surface manufacturing.
We extensively explore CSAM, covering in-flight and upon-impact particle characteristics, as well as microstructural analysis.
