title: Cold Spray Additive Manufacturing
description: Cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM) is a revolutionary technology with significant importance in the realm of advanced manufacturing. Unlike traditional additive manufacturing methods, CSAM relies on supersonic gas jets to deposit functional particles at high velocities, creating dense and high-quality coatings without the need for melting or extensive post-processing.

CSAM offers unique advantages, including the ability to work with a wide range of materials, reduced thermal stress, and improved material properties. 
It plays a crucial role in aerospace, automotive, and other industries, enabling the production of complex, high-performance components with enhanced durability and reduced material waste. 
In the SEMI-Lab, we aim to uncover process-structure-property relationships of the CSAM process to unlock its unique potential in various industries. 
For these endeavors, we thoroughly explore CSAM, from in-flight to upon-impact characteristics of the particles, as well as microstructural characterization. Our overarching objective is to employ this emerging AM technique to create functionaal and self-powered smart surfaces for the realm of Internet of
Things (IoT).
