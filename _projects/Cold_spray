title: Cold Spray Additive Manufacturing
description: Cold spray additive manufacturing (CSAM) is a revolutionary technology with significant importance in the realm of advanced manufacturing. Unlike traditional additive manufacturing methods, such as 3D printing, cold spray relies on supersonic gas jets to deposit metal or composite particles at high velocities, creating dense and high-quality parts without the need for melting or extensive post-processing.
