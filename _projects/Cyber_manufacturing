Our group advances solid-state and additive manufacturing technologies to enable in-situ fabrication, repair, and functionalization of components for In-Space Manufacturing (ISM) and In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). By creating metallic, electronic, and multifunctional structures directly from regolith-based feedstocks, our research aims to reduce Earth dependence and pave the way for sustainable, long-duration lunar and deep-space missions.
Complementarily, we investigate ISRU strategies to harness and convert lunar regolith simulants into engineering feedstocks for structural,  energy-harvesting, and dust mitigation applications. Through integrated material processing, surface engineering, and additive manufacturing, we aim to develop functional coatings and components that enable sustainable in-space construction, energy generation, and environmental resilience for future lunar and planetary missions.

<b>Our current work explores:</b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Powder engineering of lunar and Martian regolith simulants</b></li>
  <li><b>Design and development of novel regolith-based surface architectures for multifunctional applications</b></li>
  <li><b>Multi-scale additive manufacturing of regolith-derived materials</b></li>
  <li><b>Multiphysics modeling of regolith deposition under space conditions (i.e., vacuum, microgravity, radiation)</b></li>
</ul>
