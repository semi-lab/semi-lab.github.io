title: Aerosol Jet Printing
description: Aerosol jet printing (AJP) is a cutting-edge additive manufacturing technique that allows for the deposition of extremely fine lines and intricate patterns with micron-level accuracy. Its non-contact nature means it can be used to print on delicate, heat-sensitive substrates like flexible electronics and textiles.

AJP enables the simultaneous deposition of multiple materials, making it invaluable in the production of complex electronic components and e-textiles. 
Its versatility, precision, and ability to work with a wide range of materials make AJP a valuable technology in advanced manufacturing.
Our goal is to comprehensively understand the process-structure-properties of AJP, with the intention of harnessing its unique capabilities for surface manufacturing.<br>
