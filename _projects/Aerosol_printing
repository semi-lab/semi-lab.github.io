title: Aerosol Printing
description: Aerosol printing is a cutting-edge additive manufacturing technique that allows for the deposition of extremely fine lines and intricate patterns with micron-level accuracy. 
Its non-contact nature means it can be used to print on delicate, heat-sensitive substrates like flexible electronics and textiles.

CSAM offers unique advantages, enabling the production of complex, high-performance components with enhanced durability and reduced material waste.
Its remarkable features have a profound impact on industries by revolutionizing surface manufacturing and fostering sustainable practices. 
<br>
We aim to uncover process-structure-property relationships of the CSAM to unlock its unique potential in various industries. 
For these endeavors, we thoroughly investigate CSAM, from in-flight to upon-impact characteristics of the particles, as well as microstructural characterization. Our overarching objective is to explore this emerging AM technique to create functional and self-powered smart surfaces for the realm of Internet of
Things (IoT).
<br>
<br>
<b> Our current directions include:</b>
<ul>
<li> <b> Multifield modeling of CSAM. </b> </li>
<li> <b> Design and development of smart and self-powered surfaces for IoT. </b>
<li> <b> Sustainable repairing of printed electronics </b> </li>
