In SEMI-LAb, we advance <strong>Solid-State Additive Manufacturing</strong> to enable in-situ fabrication, repair, and functionalization of components for In-Space Manufacturing and In-Situ Resource Utilization. By transforming lunar and martian regolith simulants into feedstocks for structural, energy-harvesting, and dust-mitigating applications, we aim to reduce Earth dependence and support sustainable, long-duration lunar and in-space missions.
<br>
<br>
<b>Our current work explores:</b>
<ul>
  <li><b>Powder engineering of lunar and Martian regolith simulants</b></li>
  <li><b>Design and development of novel regolith-based surface architectures for multifunctional applications</b></li>
  <li><b>Multi-scale additive manufacturing of regolith-derived materials</b></li>
  <li><b>Multiphysics modeling of regolith deposition under space conditions (i.e., vacuum, microgravity, radiation)</b></li>
</ul>
