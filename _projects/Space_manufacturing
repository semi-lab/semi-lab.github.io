This research thrust advances solid-state and additive manufacturing technologies to enable the in-situ fabrication, repair, and functionalization of components for the emerging domains of In-Space Manufacturing (ISM) and In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). By producing metallic, electronic, and multifunctional structures on demand, ISM reduces Earth dependence and enhances mission adaptability for long-duration space exploration.

Complementarily, our group investigates ISRU strategies to harness and transform lunar regolith simulants into engineering feedstocks for structural, conductive, and energy-harvesting applications. Through material processing, surface engineering, and additive consolidation, ISRU enables sustainable in-space construction, energy generation, and infrastructure development essential for future lunar and planetary missions.
